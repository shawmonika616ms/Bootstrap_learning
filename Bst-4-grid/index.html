    <!-- The Grid system in Bootstrap 4. Bootstrap 4 Grid System
Bootstrap's grid system allows up to 12 columns across the page.

If you do not want to use all 12 column individually, you can group the columns together to create wider columns.
Bootstrap's grid system is responsive, and the columns will re-arrange depending on the screen size: On a big screen it might look better with the content organized in three columns, but on a small screen it would be better if the content items were stacked on top
Tip: Each class scales up, so if you wish to set the same widths for sm and md, you only need to specify sm.
Grid System Rules
Some Bootstrap 4 grid system rules:

Rows must be placed within a .container (fixed-width) or .container-fluid (full-width) for proper alignment and padding
Use rows to create horizontal groups of columns
Content should be placed within columns, and only columns may be immediate children of rows
Predefined classes like .row and .col-sm-4 are available for quickly making grid layouts
Columns create gutters (gaps between column content) via padding. That padding is offset in rows for the first and last column via negative margin on .rows
Grid columns are created by specifying the number of 12 available columns you wish to span. For example, three equa three equal columns would use three .col-sm-4
Column widths are in percentage, so they are always fluid and sized relative to their parent element
The biggest difference between Bootstrap 3 and Bootstrap 4 is that Bootstrap 4 now uses flexbox, instead of floats. One big advantage with flexbox is that grid columns without a specified width will automatically layout as equal width columns. Example: Three elements with .col-sm will each automatically be 33.33% wide from the small breakpoint and up -->
